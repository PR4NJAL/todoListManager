## Core Features to Implement:

# Add, edit, delete, and list tasks
# Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
# Set priorities and due dates
# Search and filter tasks
# Save/load from a file

## Why This Project Works:
# Covers fundamental concepts:

- Data structures (arrays, objects/structs, enums)
- File I/O operations
- String manipulation and parsing
- Error handling
- Command-line argument processing

# Teaches intermediate patterns:

- Object-oriented design (Task class, TodoManager class)
- JSON/CSV serialization
- Date/time handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Modular code organization

# Language-agnostic but reveals language personality:

In Python: You'll learn list comprehensions, decorators, context managers
In Rust: Ownership, Result types, pattern matching
In JavaScript: Async/await, JSON handling, npm ecosystem
In Java: Collections framework, exception handling, file NIO
In Go: Interfaces, goroutines (for file operations), error handling idioms

## Progressive Complexity:
# Start simple (basic CRUD operations), then add features like:

- Categories/tags
- Recurring tasks
- Export to different formats
- Simple statistics
- Color-coded output
